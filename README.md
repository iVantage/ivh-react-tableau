Load it!

```js
import IvhTableauDashboard from 'ivh-react-tableau'
```

Use it!

```jsx
<IvhTableauDashboard url='http://public.tableau.com/views/RegionalSampleWorkbook/College'
  filters={{
    'Academic Year': '2013'
  }} />
}
```

### Properties

- `user` - If using trusted authentication, the Tableau user to request a trusted ticket as. If
  not provided then trusted authentication will not be attempted.
- `tableauTrustedUrl` - The API endpoint used to fetch the trusted URL.
- `filters` - A hash of tableau filters to apply to the dashboard.
  Changes will be applied to the dashboard as this prop is updated.

## Development

This package was bootstrapped with [create-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library)
and follows its local development pattern. This is broken into two parts: the module itself, and the example
application. To start local development:

1. Run `npm start` in the repository root to build and watch the source module
2. In a second terminal `cd` into the `example` folder and run `npm start`
